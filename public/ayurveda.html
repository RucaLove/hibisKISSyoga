        <h6>Ayurveda roughly translates to the “science of life”. It is the worlds oldest form of medicine, dating beyond five thousand years, focusing on preventative healthcare, rejuvenation and longevity using natural law.</h6>
        <h6>Each of us is made up of a combination of the elements: ether (space), air, fire, water and earth. Our individual bodily make-up, or constitution, when honored allows us to live in harmony and serenity. The five elements then pair-up into three combinations (known as doshas) to form the primary forces of nature.</h6>
        <h6>Each of us carry our own unique dosha that is established at time of birth. This is known as our prakriti. Our current constitution, known as our vikriti, has the ability to change while prakriti does not. Life influences (such as diet, environmental factors, lifestyle, etc.) cause vikriti to move out of balance from our prakriti, shifting us out of harmony. In excess this can lead to disease. Ayurveda strives to keep us in a state of serenity and out of a state of stress.</h6>

        <h6>The 3 Doshas: Vata | Pitta | Kapha</h6>
        <p>Ayurveda states that each of us is born with a unique combination of elemental energies, called doshas. Our dosha is derived from a combination of the five great elements: ether, air, fire, water and earth. The doshic combination we are born with (our prakriti - see “What is Ayurveda“) stays with us throughout our lifetime, while our current state of being (vikriti) may be swayed away from our original nature by outside factors.</p>
        <p>All of us embody all three doshas, while maintaining a dominant (or dual-dominant) dosha. Keeping our original doshic nature in balance allows us to experience life in a harmonious state. The three doshas are Vata, Pitta and Kapha.</p>

        <p>Vata (ether and air):</p>
        <p>The three dominant qualities of Vata are light, cold and dry. Vata dominant individuals have thin frames and small or narrow features. They are creative, spontaneous and enjoy change and movement. Vata individuals have little or a light appetite. When Vata is out of balance it may produce anxiety, fear, insomnia, and irregular digestion.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Pitta (fire and water):</p>
        <p>The three dominant qualities of Pitta are light, hot and oily. Pitta dominant individuals have a medium build, proportionate facial features and sparkling or intense eyes. They are orderly, intense and focused. Pitta individuals have a sharp appetite and can be irritable when hungry. When Pitta is out of balance it can lead to anger, resentment, inflammation and ulcers.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Kapha (water and earth):</p>
        <p>The three dominant qualities of Kapha are heavy, cold and oily. Kapha dominant individuals have a large build with full, soft features. They are relaxed, patient and conservative. Kapha individuals have stable and regular digestion, but can be prone to emotional or “boredom” eating. When Kapha is out of balance it can cause attachment, lethargy, depression and congestion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Vata is balanced using warm, wet and heavy elements. Pitta is balanced through cool, relaxing and nurturing methods. Kapha is balanced by energizing, mobilizing and stimulating means.</p>
        <p>*The statements expressed above are general descriptions and do not reflect all considerations. To determine individual doshic combination, schedule a consultation.</p>
